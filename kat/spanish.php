            <p>Last year, I decided to pursue a minor in Spanish, and I will be taking another course to continue that this semester. When I first came to college, I started taking German, but after one semester I decided that it wasn’t for me, and chose to switch back to Spanish, which I had taken in high school. I now have three courses left to fulfill the minor, including the one I am taking this fall, and I am hoping to finish the last one through a summer program in Ecuador. The program runs for four weeks, and consists of classes during the day, and various trips and excursions on the weekends. This trip seems like an excellent way to experience another culture, practice different language skills, and, as someone who has lived in Rochester her whole life, serve as a much needed change of scenery.</p>

            <p>To fulfill my social science cluster at UR, I’ve decided to follow a history track, which has consisted so far in classes about Western New York and the evolution of technology. Studying the origins and development of technology is an interesting contrast to most of the DMS courses, which direct more towards its present and future uses in society. For my natural science cluster, I am focusing on Environmental Science, which I believe is something that is very important to learn about, given how rapidly the world and its ecosystems are changing. The Environmental Science and Oceanography classes I took both focused on that a lot, and provided a lot of information about the effects that our actions have on the planet.</p>
