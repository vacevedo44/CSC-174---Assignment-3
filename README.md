	The website will have a home page that will link to all the DMS Majors. Each DMS Major (Kat, Maria, Jen) will have a "Main" page where they describe themselves and give more content that has less to do with them as DMS Majors. Each will then have a second page titled "Why DMS?" which will focus on why they decided to major in DMS at the University of Rochester. The third page will be "Other Academic Interests" in which each DMS Major describes other academic interests they have.
